### Database Glossary


1. **JCN (Job Control Number)**
   - **Description:** Historical identifier from US Navy terminology to identify a specific job on a ship. Now replaced by Work Order generated by ABS NSE CMMS system. In the database, JCN is a combination of the hull number followed by a dash and the work order number. Older formats include identifiers from the IMDS system and manually generated identifiers by NAVSEA or other entities.

2. **TWCODE (Technical Writer Code)**
   - **Description:** Combination of the Technical Writer identifier and a sequential number given to each individual entry on a Material Requirements List (MRL). Must be combined with the JCN for complete data integrity.

3. **Nomenclature**
   - **Description:** Noun description of material being ordered. Additional descriptive or order assistance information is no longer allowed.

4. **COG (Cognizance Symbol)**
   - **Description:** Two-position prefix used by the Navy to provide supply management information. Sometimes contains other data formats which are to be removed or changed to comply with the original intended purpose.

5. **FSC (Federal Supply Classification)**
   - **Description:** Four-digit code used to classify items of supply identified under the Federal Cataloging Program. The first two digits identify the Federal Supply Group (FSG), and the last two digits identify the classes within each group. Sometimes contains different formats which are to be discontinued and removed in the future.

6. **NIIN (NATO Item Identification Number)**
   - **Description:** Last 9 digits of a NSN, unique to an item over its entire lifetime. A single supply item may have multiple NSNs but only one active NSN at any time.

7. **NSN (National Stock Number)**
   - **Description:** The 13-digit number that identifies a stock item, consisting of the 4-digit Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code plus the 9-digit National Item Identification Number (NIIN). The coding system has been adopted by NATO and other non-member nations.
   - **History:** The NSN replaced the Federal Stock Number (FSN) in 1974. The FSN was an 11-digit numeric code developed by the DoD in 1949. Two digits were added to the 11-digit FSN to signify the country of origin. Now, both NSN and NATO Stock Number are interchangeable terms.

8. **Qty**
   - **Description:** The quantity of the item that is to be ordered.

9. **UI (Unit Of Issue)**
   - **Description:** Unit of Measure (UOM). Determines the measuring unit for the material. Sometimes the ordered UI/UOM will differ from the procured UI/UOM and must have an equivalence calculation.

10. **Market Research UP**
    - **Description:** Unit price in USD determined by market research. Usually determined by information received from Haystack GOLD or historical information.

11. **Market Research EP**
    - **Description:** Total estimated price in USD (unit price * quantity), based on market research.

12. **Request Date**
    - **Description:** The date when the Logistics Service Center (LSC) submits the line item for fulfillment/procurement.

13. **RDD**
    - **Description:** Required Delivery Date by which an item must be received in Egypt.

14. **PRI**
    - **Description:** Priority set for procurement of the item.

16. **Suggested Source**
    - **Description:** Recommended or known vendor and contact/shipping information where an item is believed to be procured.

17. **MFG CAGE (Manufacturer CAGE Code)**
    - **Description:** Unique identifier for manufacturers/suppliers, assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).

18. **APL (Allowance Parts List)**
    - **Description:** Authorized list of parts for maintenance and repair.

19. **Techmanual**
    - **Description:** Specification for the technical manual where the specified material is referenced (e.g., JFMM, NSTM).

20. **DWG/PC**
    - **Description:** Drawing/Illustration reference in the technical manual where the item is specified.

21. **Requestor Remarks**
    - **Description:** Notes added by KPPO Material Manager for processing, clarification, or internal notes relevant to the item.

22. **Inquiry Status**
    - **Description:** Flag set when a database user has requested review of the line item and its status or history.

23. **Created By**
    - **Description:** The user who created the line item in this database.

24. **Status**
    - **Description:** The current logistical status of the line item. Automatically generated by information received by all fulfillment records linked to the MRL line item.

25. **Status Value**
    - **Description:** Numeric representation of the status, intended to determine a progressive value of the status for analysis purposes.

26. **Received Quantity**
    - **Description:** Field used to quickly determine the progress in procuring an item with multiple fulfillment records.

27. **Has Comments**
    - **Description:** Indicates whether any manually entered information has been provided by any database user for the line item for any purpose.

28. **Multiple Shipments**
    - **Description:** Indicates if the line item has more than one fulfillment record.


Here are the additional glossary terms you previously defined:

1. **MRL (Material Requirements List)**
   - **Description:** A list of materials required for a specific project or operation. The MRL is tied to one or more Work Items and provides a detailed breakdown of all necessary materials. The MRL Line Item is an individual entry on an MRL and is the record by which all material is tracked during the fulfillment/procurement process. It is immutable in all its details and may not be changed in nomenclature, quantity, or any other detail. Errors in the MRL line item must be corrected by generating a new MRL line item via the KPPO Material Manager.

2. **Fulfillment Record**
   - **Description:** The record that exists to provide a unique interface for any logistics center requiring a specific record including their own nomenclature, identification, etc., or for any instances in which multiple subprocess records are needed to faithfully track a single MRL line item (order). The fulfillment record is created any time procurement information is generated or available for any MRL line item and contains that information. In most cases, an MRL line item will only have one fulfillment record, but this division allows for those cases when more are required.

3. **Fulfillment**
   - **Description:** Can also be referred to as procurement, purchase order, acquisition, shipment, or any other subprocess in the logistics process. Fulfillment involves the process of acquiring and delivering the materials listed in the MRL to the designated location.

These terms should be added to the glossary for a comprehensive understanding of the database schema and its functionality.

It appears the previously defined terms and their detailed definitions were not retained in a retrievable format. Based on the context and the information previously discussed, I'll recreate the glossary entries for the additional terms you mentioned.
