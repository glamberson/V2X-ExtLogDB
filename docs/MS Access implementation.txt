Integrating PostgreSQL user roles and permissions into an MS Access frontend requires a few steps to ensure that the application uses the correct database roles based on the authenticated user. Below are the detailed steps and logic to implement this:

### Steps to Implement Application Logic in MS Access

1. **Create PostgreSQL Roles**: Already completed as per previous instructions.
2. **Create a Login Form in MS Access**: This form will handle user authentication.
3. **Establish DSN-less Connections in MS Access**: Use VBA to connect to PostgreSQL with the correct role.
4. **Map Application Users to PostgreSQL Roles**: Implement logic in MS Access VBA to map users to roles.
5. **Set Up User Permissions in MS Access**: Ensure users can only perform actions they are permitted to do.

### Detailed Steps

#### Step 1: Create a Login Form in MS Access

1. Open your MS Access database.
2. Create a new form for login (e.g., `frmLogin`).
3. Add two text boxes: one for the username (`txtUsername`) and one for the password (`txtPassword`).
4. Add a button for login (`btnLogin`).

#### Step 2: Create a Table for Application Users

Ensure your PostgreSQL `users` table is set up as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role_id INT REFERENCES roles(role_id),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Step 3: Establish DSN-less Connections in MS Access

Use VBA to connect to PostgreSQL. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Open the VBA editor in MS Access (ALT + F11).
2. Create a new module (e.g., `modDBConnection`).
3. Add the following code to handle the connection:

```vba
Option Compare Database
Option Explicit

Public dbConnection As ADODB.Connection

Public Function GetDBConnection(username As String, password As String, role As String) As ADODB.Connection
    Dim connString As String
    Set dbConnection = New ADODB.Connection
    
    Select Case role
        Case "KPPO Admin"
            connString = "Driver={PostgreSQL Unicode};Server=your_server;Port=5432;Database=your_database;Uid=kppo_admin_user;Pwd=admin_password;"
        Case "Chesapeake Warehouse", "NAVSUP", "Logistics Service Center (LSC)"
            connString = "Driver={PostgreSQL Unicode};Server=your_server;Port=5432;Database=your_database;Uid=readonly_user;Pwd=readonly_password;"
        Case "Report Viewer"
            connString = "Driver={PostgreSQL Unicode};Server=your_server;Port=5432;Database=your_database;Uid=report_viewer_user;Pwd=report_password;"
        Case Else
            MsgBox "Invalid role"
            Exit Function
    End Select
    
    dbConnection.Open connString
    Set GetDBConnection = dbConnection
End Function
```

#### Step 4: Implement the Login Logic

1. In the `frmLogin` form, add the following VBA code:

```vba
Private Sub btnLogin_Click()
    Dim username As String
    Dim password As String
    Dim role As String
    Dim dbConn As ADODB.Connection
    
    username = Me.txtUsername.Value
    password = Me.txtPassword.Value
    
    ' Authenticate the user (you can implement a query to your PostgreSQL database here)
    role = AuthenticateUser(username, password)
    
    If role <> "" Then
        Set dbConn = GetDBConnection(username, password, role)
        If Not dbConn Is Nothing Then
            MsgBox "Login successful"
            ' Proceed to the main form or application
        Else
            MsgBox "Connection failed"
        End If
    Else
        MsgBox "Authentication failed"
    End If
End Sub

Private Function AuthenticateUser(username As String, password As String) As String
    Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset
    Dim strSQL As String
    Dim role As String
    
    Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset
    strSQL = "SELECT roles.role_name FROM users INNER JOIN roles ON users.role_id = roles.role_id WHERE username = '" & username & "' AND password_hash = crypt('" & password & "', password_hash)"
    
    rs.Open strSQL, CurrentProject.Connection, adOpenStatic, adLockReadOnly
    
    If Not rs.EOF Then
        role = rs.Fields("role_name").Value
    Else
        role = ""
    End If
    
    rs.Close
    Set rs = Nothing
    
    AuthenticateUser = role
End Function
```

#### Step 5: Set Up User Permissions in MS Access

1. Restrict form access based on user roles. For example, disable certain buttons or controls for read-only users.
2. Use the `Open` event of forms to check user roles and set permissions accordingly.

```vba
Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer)
    Dim role As String
    ' Assume role is stored in a global variable or session after login
    role = GetCurrentUserRole()
    
    Select Case role
        Case "KPPO Admin"
            ' Full access
        Case "Chesapeake Warehouse", "NAVSUP", "Logistics Service Center (LSC)"
            ' Read-only access to most forms, but write access to fulfillment items and comments
            Me.AllowEdits = False
            Me.AllowDeletions = False
            Me.AllowAdditions = False
        Case "Report Viewer"
            ' Read-only access to everything except comments
            Me.AllowEdits = False
            Me.AllowDeletions = False
            Me.AllowAdditions = False
            ' Enable comments section here if needed
        Case Else
            MsgBox "Invalid role"
            Cancel = True
    End Select
End Sub
```

### Summary

1. **Create Login Form**: In MS Access to handle user authentication.
2. **Define Application Users**: In your PostgreSQL database.
3. **Establish DSN-less Connections**: Using VBA to connect to PostgreSQL with the appropriate role.
4. **Implement Login Logic**: Using VBA to authenticate users and connect to the database.
5. **Set Up User Permissions**: In MS Access based on user roles.
