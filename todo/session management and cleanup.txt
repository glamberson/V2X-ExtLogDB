To verify your user/role setup and session management within PostgreSQL, let's review the relevant portions of your configuration and code, focusing particularly on how session management and termination are handled. Based on your provided scripts and typical best practices, here is an overview:

### 1. User/Role Setup in PostgreSQL

#### User and Role Creation
You should have roles and users defined with specific permissions. Here is an example of how roles and users might be set up:
```sql
-- Create roles
CREATE ROLE mrl_user;
CREATE ROLE mrl_admin;

-- Create users and assign roles
CREATE USER user1 WITH PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT mrl_user TO user1;

CREATE USER admin1 WITH PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT mrl_admin TO admin1;
```

#### Granting Permissions
Permissions should be granted to the roles rather than directly to users:
```sql
-- Granting permissions to roles
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO mrl_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO mrl_admin;
```

### 2. Session Management in PostgreSQL

#### Session Token Management
You can implement session management using a combination of database tables and functions. Here is an example approach:

1. **Session Table**:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE user_sessions (
        session_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
        valid_until TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

2. **Creating a Session**:
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_session(p_user_id INT, p_duration INTERVAL) RETURNS UUID AS $$
    DECLARE
        v_session_id UUID := uuid_generate_v4();
        v_valid_until TIMESTAMP := NOW() + p_duration;
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO user_sessions (session_id, user_id, valid_until) 
        VALUES (v_session_id, p_user_id, v_valid_until);
        RETURN v_session_id;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    ```

3. **Validating a Session**:
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_session(p_session_id UUID) RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
    DECLARE
        v_valid BOOLEAN;
    BEGIN
        SELECT COUNT(*) > 0 INTO v_valid
        FROM user_sessions 
        WHERE session_id = p_session_id AND valid_until > NOW();
        RETURN v_valid;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    ```

4. **Terminating a Session**:
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION terminate_session(p_session_id UUID) RETURNS VOID AS $$
    BEGIN
        DELETE FROM user_sessions WHERE session_id = p_session_id;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    ```

### 3. Automatic Session Termination

To automatically terminate sessions when they expire, you can use a PostgreSQL background worker or a cron job that periodically cleans up expired sessions. Here is an example using a cron job:

1. **Create a Cleanup Function**:
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_expired_sessions() RETURNS VOID AS $$
    BEGIN
        DELETE FROM user_sessions WHERE valid_until <= NOW();
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    ```

2. **Set Up a Cron Job**:
    Using `pg_cron` extension, you can set up a scheduled task to run the cleanup function:
    ```sql
    -- Install pg_cron extension if not already installed
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;

    -- Schedule the cleanup job to run every hour
    SELECT cron.schedule('cleanup_expired_sessions', '0 * * * *', 'CALL cleanup_expired_sessions()');
    ```

### Summary

- **User/Role Setup**: Ensure roles are properly set up and permissions are granted to roles, which are then assigned to users.
- **Session Management**: Implement session creation, validation, and termination with appropriate functions and a session table.
- **Automatic Session Termination**: Use a cleanup function and a scheduled task (cron job) to remove expired sessions.

Based on the scripts and configuration you have provided, your setup appears to be on the right track. Ensure that the cleanup process is in place to handle expired sessions automatically, which will help in managing sessions effectively.
